# Dual Farms

Dual Farms are an innovative farming mechanism that allows farmers to receive TWO reward tokens (HRMS and one supplied by the partner) at independent rates. Our dual farm contracts were inspired by TraderJoe, the leading DEX on AVAX. This allows for greater complexity, higher APR, less direct sell pressure, and launchpad-like abilities compared to traditional farms that can only reward a single token.
